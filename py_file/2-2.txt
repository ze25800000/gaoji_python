What does it feel like to have your sibling die?
Answered by John Clover
Pretty miserable.

My sister died at the age of 18 when I was 16.

She was attending her first semester of college majoring in Psychology at Florida State University when she came down with mono.

She came home to recover and due to her weakened immune system she ended up with viral pneumonia. I only remember some bits so they may not fit together (I still remember the date she died as different from her official date of death among other things), but as her symptoms worsened, my parents contacted her doctor on a Friday, who said to wait until Monday to come in, since the symptoms of the pneumonia were much the same as those of the mono.

My sister died before she could get to the doctor.

I remember my parents coming into my bedroom at night and waking me up, saying "Rebecca isn't breathing! "

8. Like a good Boy Scout, I was always prepared. I stormed down the stairs, and went through the procedures I was certified for. My sister was on the floor next to the couch where she had been sleeping. There was fluid in her airway, I cleared it and began CPR. I told my parents to call 911 and continued until the paramedics arrived.
